There are, of course, the solutions proposed directly by GitHub page, however, it looks a bit \u0026ldquo;old school\u0026rdquo; in my opinion. Another option is to make the site by yourself in markdown, but it seemed quite long and tedious. Personally, I finally came across the Academic theme1 for Hugo2 that suits my needs and is the purpose of this tutorial! Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions and/or additional information.\n You need to be a bit familiar with the basics of GitHub, but you don\u0026rsquo;t need any knowledge of html/css.   1. Make a GitHub page You can directly follow the instructions on their page: https://pages.github.com/.\n The important is to create the repository your-name.github.io, then we will update the content of this repository automatically with the Academic Theme.\n2. Install Academic Theme and Hugo Again you\u0026rsquo;ll find the steps on their website: https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/#install-with-git\n There are different ways to install the Academic theme. The recommended installation will automatically deploy it on a free server, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a way to link it to the GitHub page later, so I recommend to follow the Git installation from the link above.   Install Hugo I had some trouble with installing Hugo with Homebrew on Linux. If you do have the same problem, I advise you to try to install it with the snap version (don\u0026rsquo;t install it with apt-get because the version is not updated: see this issue). All this Academic theme is based on the Hugo Framework so it is necessary to install it.\nFork the Academic Kickstart repository   It will automatically create a new repository academic-kickstart in your GitHub account. This repository will allow you to manage your website, and then to publish it into the previously create repository your-name.github.io. Finally, you just need to clone and initialize the theme on your computer:\ngit clone https://github.com/your-name/academic-kickstart.git cd academic-kickstart git submodule update --init --recursive  3. Deploy your website on your GitHub page We need now to add your-name.github.io repository as a submodule inside the public folder of the academic-kickstart repository as explained in this documentation.\ngit submodule add -f -b master https://github.com/your-name/your-name.github.io.git public  Then you need to generate the website with the hugo command. First, you can commit and push your changes from the academic-kickstart repository on GitHub and then do the same for the your-name.github.io submodule and your website will be available online!\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot; git push -u origin master hugo # Generate the website inside the public directory cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Build website\u0026quot; git push origin master cd ..  You can easily make this automatic with a bash script for the future, for example: update.sh, and then you only have to write: sh update.sh your_commit_message.\n4. Update your content and customize your page You can then follow the documentation  Getting Started With the Page Builder and  Customization, where you\u0026rsquo;ll find all the information! Basically before to start updating, launch the hugo server from your local academic-kickstart folder with the command:\nhugo server  you will be able to have an instant preview in your browser before uploading it to GitHub. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know any editing software, I can advise you Atom in combination with typora that is really convenient for directly editing the content with markdown.\n  Source Themes Academic 4.8.0 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hugo Static Site Generator v0.70.0/extended linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-05-13T17:30:34Z \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1589881138,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589900182,"objectID":"904c709eb1c02818fd220c3b8c7fde5c","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/post/how-to-create-an-academic-github-page-with-hugo/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T11:38:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/how-to-create-an-academic-github-page-with-hugo/","section":"post","summary":"I guess you are wondering how to make an academic website on your GitHub with the address .github.io.
