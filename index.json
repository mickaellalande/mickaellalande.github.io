If however their method does not suit your needs and you want to install your own environment, here is the method I use (it works from a Linux workstation, you have to adapt if you are under another OS). This method is not official, nor generic, if you have other tips/methods don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to share them in the comments below.\n1. Connect to your server ssh -XY -o ServerAliveInterval=60 login@server  Think to add the options -XY otherwise you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to open Jupyter Notebooks in your browser. ServerAliveInterval=60 is optional, but it allows you not to get disconnected if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any activity for a while (it depends on servers).\n You can directly make an alias in your bashrc, so you only have to type the alias in your terminal.   For example:\ngvim ~/.bashrc # And add this line at the end or in an alias section if you already have one alias server='ssh -XY -o ServerAliveInterval=60 login@server'  2. Install Miniconda In general, there is not infinite space on the servers and therefore I advise you to install the minimalist version of Anaconda : Miniconda, in order to install only what you need.\nSo first of all, I download Miniconda on the server and install it:\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh   During the installation, be careful to change the installation path to avoid installing it in your home, otherwise, it may saturate your space very quickly! In general, it is recommended to install it in a data space or another where you have more storage space.\n[/home/login/miniconda3] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; /data/login/miniconda3\n  At the end of the installation, I recommend that you initialize conda so that it automatically adds the correct path to your bashrc so that you can directly have the conda command available (if you prefer to put these lines somewhere else, you can adapt them).\nDo you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3 by running conda init? [yes|no] [no] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; yes  Then update your bashrc:\nsource ~/.bashrc  You should have a (base) that should appear in front of your command line.\n If you are not happy, fucked up any step or you are scared\u0026hellip; that happens\u0026hellip; Just remove the folder miniconda3 (rm -r /data/login/miniconda3 or the path you put at the installation step) and then remove the lines that were added in your bashrc. Then you can start over or forget about Miniconda forever :p   3. Add conda-forge and update your installation (optional but I recommend) This step is completely optional, but it allows to facilitate the installation of future packages that would not be the basic channel of conda.\nconda config --add channels conda-forge conda config --set channel_priority strict conda update -n base -c defaults conda  If you want to know more, click on the link in the title.\n4. Create an environment I do not recommend that you use your base environment. By experience, it happened to me several times to break this environment without being able to go back and to have to finally reinstall everything. The problem is that when you are not familiar with the environment you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make a backup and it is sometimes difficult to get back to something functional!\nSo here is how I work on my side, I create an environment with the name of my project and a version (for example project_v0):\nconda create -n project_v0 conda activate project_v0  Then install all the packages you need, especially jupyter (+ jupyterlab if you prefer from basic notebooks, which is my case).\nI also recommend you to install the nb_conda_kernels package in each of your environments, which will allow you to switch from one environment to another, directly from your notebooks.\nconda install nb_conda_kernels   Here is an example of an environment I created for my Ph.D.: https://github.com/mickaellalande/PhD/tree/master/envs/phd   To save and manage your environment, see at the end of this tutorial.\nFor simplicity, I also recommend that you add the line conda activate project_v0 to your bashrc so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to activate it every time. This should replace the (base) with the name of your environment.\n5. Configure Jupyter The problem with launching Jupyter on a server is that you will have to make an ssh bridge between your machine and the server to open Jupyter directly on your internet browser. So you have to specify to Jupyter not to open a window on the server and to open Jupyter on a specific port (if needed).\nThere are two ways to do this, either you specify all this in your command when you run Jupyter, or you create a configuration file:\nCommand line Here is an example of a command line (where XXXX would be your port number), but don\u0026rsquo;t run it yet, it would be for later!\njupyter lab --port XXXX --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser  Configuration file Alternatively, you can put this directly into a configuration file and just run the command jupyter lab (or jupyter notebook):\n# Create a configuration file and edit it jupyter notebook --generate-config gvim ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py # Uncomment these lines and modify them as follow c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*' c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0' c.NotebookApp.port = XXXX c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False  More informations:\n https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42848130/why-i-cant-access-remote-jupyter-notebook-server  Report errors (optionnal) Optionally you can also send automatically report to Anaconda in case of errors:\nconda config --set report_errors true  6. Launch a job This step depends on the server you are on, so find out how to launch an interactive job. Depending on the servers and their security level, it can be more or less complicated (even more so during teleworking if you use intermediate machines!).\nThink of adapting the memory you need, because very often jobs are killed if you exceed it.\n7. Run Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab Once your job is launched you can now directly run jupyter lab or jupyter notebook if you configured Jupyter (see above) otherwise:\njupyter lab --port XXXX --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser  Then you need to make a tunnel from your own terminal (on your PC, not the server), which is usually a command as:\nssh -L XXXX:hostname:XXXX login@server  with possible other flags as -fNL (but I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar with that, so go and look what you need, ex: https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=ssh+-L+-N+-f+-l)\nThen you can open the link directly given from Jupyter on the server, which will open on your browser.\nHere is an example of a script, to get automatically the ssh tunnel from one of the servers I use and run jupyter lab (you can inspire yourself from that and adapt it to your needs): jupyterlab.sh.\n8. Save your environment Once you have something functional and stable enough. I advise you to save your environment and not to touch it anymore (not even to update it). If you want to update it or install new packages (which would cause version changes in your other packages), in that case I advise you to clone your current environment and do some tests then if you get something stable again, call it with the same project name and increment the version number by making a new backup. This way you can always go back to an old environment and/or rebuild it identically (at least on the machine you were on).\nTo save your environment here are the different methods I use:\nconda list --explicit \u0026gt; projet_v0.txt conda env export \u0026gt; projet_v0.yml conda env export --from-history \u0026gt; projet_v0_fh.yml  The first one allows you to have the exact version of packages on the machine you are using and their dependencies, which will allow you to have exactly the same environment (however it might not work on some other machines). The second one is similar to the first one but with the yaml format. The last one allows you to only have the names of the packages you installed with their version number if specified (what I advise you to add otherwise it might not work in the future). This last one allows sharing your environment across different platforms/OS, but without a guaranty that it will work (knowing that some packages are not always available across all platforms) and even on your own machine/server if you didn\u0026rsquo;t specify all version numbers, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that you won\u0026rsquo;t succeed to make it work in the future. Hence I recommend saving your environment under different format/version.\nTo get more information, go and check the conda documentation: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html\nI also recommend you to document your environment with a README, so you know how you set it up, what\u0026rsquo;s inside, etc., here is an example from my environment: https://github.com/mickaellalande/PhD/tree/master/envs/phd.\nI hope this will help you! I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert with conda myself, but this is a sharing of the experience I\u0026rsquo;ve gained over the past few years. Feel free to ask questions in the comments and/or fill in any points that I haven\u0026rsquo;t explained well or that are missing!\n","date":1619078436,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619102375,"objectID":"b728a70d28ce6c5291a7bcf9fd8260f8","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/post/tutorial/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-a-server/","publishdate":"2021-04-22T10:00:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/tutorial/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-a-server/","section":"post","summary":"First of all, I recommend you to look at what your server proposes as a method to launch Jupyter Notebooks.

However, the regional imprint of climate change is still poorly understood, in particular, because it is mixed with large internal variability. Such uncertainty is even more pronounced in mountainous areas because: (i) meteorological in situ observations are scarce and (ii) the coarse resolution of global climate models is not adapted to reproduce the surface-atmosphere interactions and local circulation patterns over areas of complex topography. For these reasons, climate change is poorly known, and future scenarios are particularly uncertain in the Himalayan region, whereas they can be associated with major socio-environmental impacts, in particular in terms of water resources and natural hazards. This Ph.D.1 project aims to investigate trends and variability of the Himalayan climate with the LMDZ global model with a stretched grid centered over this area. First, a 1900-2010 experiment will be run with a configuration nudged toward the ERA-20C atmospheric reanalysis. Long-term simulations will be used to investigate climate trends over the last century and decadal to multi-decadal changes of atmospheric conditions that could explain temporary positive trends of glacier mass balance in this area. Second, a subgrid-scale parameterization of the surface energy balance will be implemented in the model, with the aim to improve the representation of the climate and the snow cover in mountainous areas. Third, LMDZ will be used in configurations nudged toward future scenarios and experiments dedicated to the differentiation of aerosol and GHG forcings. This Ph.D. project will allow a better understanding of the climate and the cryosphere changes in the Himalaya, with the final goal to provide different climate scenarios for the next century in this mountainous area.\n  supervised by Martin Ménégoz and Gerhard Krinner \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1589900900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590421328,"objectID":"c9a66b2d3f935438f991c02f81127b35","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/project/phd/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T17:08:20+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/phd/","section":"project","summary":"Modeling climate trends and variability in the Himalaya to understand cryosphere changes","tags":["Himalaya","Cryosphere","LMDZ"],"title":"PhD (2019-2022)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande"],"categories":["Tutorial"],"content":"I guess you are wondering how to make an academic website on your GitHub with the address .github.io. There are, of course, the solutions proposed directly by GitHub page, however, it looks a bit \u0026ldquo;old school\u0026rdquo; in my opinion. Another option is to make the site by yourself in markdown, but it seemed quite long and tedious. Personally, I finally came across the Academic theme1 for Hugo2 that suits my needs and is the purpose of this tutorial! Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions and/or additional information.\n You need to be a bit familiar with the basics of GitHub, but you don\u0026rsquo;t need any knowledge of html/css.   1. Make a GitHub page You can directly follow the instructions on their page: https://pages.github.com/.\n The important is to create the repository your-name.github.io, then we will update the content of this repository automatically with the Academic Theme.\n2. Install Academic Theme and Hugo Again you\u0026rsquo;ll find the steps on their website: https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/#install-with-git\n There are different ways to install the Academic theme. The recommended installation will automatically deploy it on a free server, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a way to link it to the GitHub page later, so I recommend to follow the Git installation from the link above.   Install Hugo I had some trouble with installing Hugo with Homebrew on Linux. If you do have the same problem, I advise you to try to install it with the snap version (don\u0026rsquo;t install it with apt-get because the version is not updated: see this issue). All this Academic theme is based on the Hugo Framework so it is necessary to install it.\nFork the Academic Kickstart repository   It will automatically create a new repository academic-kickstart in your GitHub account. This repository will allow you to manage your website, and then to publish it into the previously create repository your-name.github.io. Finally, you just need to clone and initialize the theme on your computer:\ngit clone https://github.com/your-name/academic-kickstart.git cd academic-kickstart git submodule update --init --recursive  3. Deploy your website on your GitHub page We need now to add your-name.github.io repository as a submodule inside the public folder of the academic-kickstart repository as explained in this documentation.\ngit submodule add -f -b master https://github.com/your-name/your-name.github.io.git public  Then you need to generate the website with the hugo command. First, you can commit and push your changes from the academic-kickstart repository on GitHub and then do the same for the your-name.github.io submodule and your website will be available online!\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot; git push -u origin master hugo # Generate the website inside the public directory cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Build website\u0026quot; git push origin master cd ..  You can easily make this automatic with a bash script for the future, for example: update.sh, and then you only have to write: sh update.sh your_commit_message.\n4.
