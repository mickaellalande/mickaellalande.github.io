Indeed, those models have been developed and designed for Alpine snowpacks, which evolve differently from Arctic ones due to higher wind speeds, increasing the compaction of the upper snowpack layers, and stronger temperature gradients, inducing upward water vapor fluxes within the snowpack and influencing the compaction and metamorphism. Both phenomena – combined with complex interactions with the vegetation – are at the origin of the wind-slab and depth hoar formation in Arctic snowpacks. The Canadian Land Surface Scheme including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC) – being the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM) land surface component – uses a medium-complexity single-layer snow scheme. Whether correctly representing Arctic snowpack bulk characteristics requires a multilayer approach over a single-layer snow scheme is still an open question. To assess the model skills, 1D simulations were performed at ten sites – including three Arctic sites. Improvements in the snow model scheme were carried out, including three new parameterizations to better represent Arctic snow: (1) blowing snow sublimation losses, (2) wind inclusion in the computation of fresh snow density, and (3) increased wind compaction. Those improvements allow most of the current model skills to be improved at the Arctic sites. Uncertainties related to the meteorological forcing, variable measurements, snow drift, and model bias compensations are a perpetual challenge in those model assessments. Future studies will involve spatial evaluation of those model developments in addition to implementing new snow cover fraction parameterization in CLASSIC. The influence of these new developments will be assessed against the ESA Snow CCI variables for different land types and for the simulated surface energy and carbon fluxes.","tags":["Snow","Model","CLASSIC","Arctic"],"title":"Colloque CEN 2025: Improvement of the CLASSIC Snow Model to Better Simulate Arctic Snowpacks","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande","Christophe Kinnard","Alexandre Roy"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1733844000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1745507017,"objectID":"0a7e5748fde2b0e79c6caec414407a3b","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/snowc2/agu/agu24/","publishdate":"2025-01-29T14:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/snowc2/agu/agu24/","section":"talk","summary":"https://agu.confex.com/agu/agu24/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1507414","tags":["Snow","Model","CLASSIC","Arctic"],"title":"AGU24: Improvement of the CLASSIC Snow Model to Better Simulate Arctic Snowpacks","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1729065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1728307457,"objectID":"a0e2fdba8da45c82994bb521f168fe04","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/snowc2/esa-cci/cci-colocation-2024/","publishdate":"2024-10-07T08:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/snowc2/esa-cci/cci-colocation-2024/","section":"talk","summary":"CCI Colocation \u0026 CMUG Integration meetings 2024","tags":["Snow","Model","CLASSIC","Arctic"],"title":"CCI Colocation 2024: Snow cover heterogeneity and its impact on the Climate and Carbon cycle of Arctic regions (SnowC2)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1727964000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1728307457,"objectID":"0055c35619301fbc123e204fff3241c3","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/snowc2/esa-cci/midterm-review-meeting/","publishdate":"2024-10-03T09:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/snowc2/esa-cci/midterm-review-meeting/","section":"talk","summary":" ","tags":["Snow","Model","CLASSIC","Arctic"],"title":"ESA CCI SnowC² Mid-Term Review Meeting","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande","Christophe Kinnard","Alexandre Roy"],"categories":null,"content":" 2024 Annual Meeting of the CGU 2024 COHERENT-C/CLASSIC workshop Lightening Talk (COHERENT-C/CLASSIC) Poster (CGU + COHERENT-C/CLASSIC) ","date":1716699600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1716472599,"objectID":"8264c374da3fb1dd1b660153a21f6267","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/snowc2/cgu-classic/2024/","publishdate":"2024-05-23T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/snowc2/cgu-classic/2024/","section":"talk","summary":" 2024 Annual Meeting of the CGU 2024 COHERENT-C/CLASSIC workshop Lightening Talk (COHERENT-C/CLASSIC) Poster (CGU + COHERENT-C/CLASSIC) ","tags":["Snow","Model","CLASSIC","Arctic"],"title":"CGU \u0026 COHERENT-C/CLASSIC workshop 2024: Snow cover heterogeneity and its impact on the Climate and Carbon cycle of Arctic regions (SnowC2)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande"],"categories":null,"content":" CLASSIC webpage: https://cccma.gitlab.io/classic_pages/ CLASSIC code: https://gitlab.com/cccma/classic ","date":1712772000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712753033,"objectID":"eb2789d45b0d86a77d782e3199d800e1","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/snowc2/classic-meeting/20240410/","publishdate":"2024-04-10T07:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/snowc2/classic-meeting/20240410/","section":"talk","summary":"This talk describes the preliminary work intended to serve as a basis for the development of a multilayer snow model adapted for the Arctic region in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme Including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC). Ten sites – including three Arctic sites – have been set to run the model in 1D simulations to assess the skills of the snow model’s physics. Three model configurations were used: (1) an older model version (CLASS v3.6) used in the latest Snow Model Intercomparison Project (SnowMIP), and (2, 3) the latest model version (CLASSIC v1.0) with a windless exchange coefficient activated or not in the calculation of the sensible heat fluxes. The new and old model versions demonstrate similar skills in simulating the snowpack at most of the sites, although the new version performs slightly better in simulating the albedo, soil temperatures, and snow cover duration. Activating the windless exchange coefficient allows a simulated snow surface temperature cold bias of about -2 °C to be alleviated but at the detriment of inducing an underestimation of the simulated snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) of about 10 cm and 25 to 50 kg m-2, respectively. Overall, the model demonstrates good skills in simulating the snowpack at most of the mid-latitude sites, with, however, a tendency to overestimate albedo at the end of the snow season, likely due to the non-consideration of the deposition of the light-absorbing particles on snow. At the Arctic sites, the model exhibits larger biases, especially in simulating the soil temperatures. Inherent uncertainties in snow modeling pose significant challenges in evaluating models, particularly in locations where snow distribution is influenced by blowing snow transport. Future work will consist of implementing a multilayer snowpack within CLASSIC, including consideration of blowing snow sublimation losses and adaptation to Arctic snowpack characteristics.","tags":["Snow","Model","LSM","CLASSIC","Arctic"],"title":"CLASSIC biweekly meeting: Snow cover heterogeneity and its impact on the Climate and Carbon cycle of Arctic regions","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande","Christophe Kinnard","Alexandre Roy"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1707886800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1708358647,"objectID":"4662a1f0e895e3ee46fb22c64cd8563f","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/snowc2/cen/colloque-2024/","publishdate":"2024-02-19T10:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/snowc2/cen/colloque-2024/","section":"talk","summary":"One of the current limitations of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC) is the use of a single-layer snow scheme, without an explicit parameterization for the snow cover fraction (SCF) and blowing snow sublimation losses.

However, blowing snow sublimation losses are significant in the Arctic, and snowpacks are typically characterized by at least two distinct snow layers (e.g., a base depth hoar layer overlain by a wind slab), which have distinct physical characteristics. Moreover, the snow cover varies greatly at the typical scales from ~10-100 meters (due to snow–canopy interactions, snow redistribution by the wind, pronounced microtopography, etc.) to larger-scale (\u0026gt;1 km) due to climatic and orographic gradients (e.g., Liston, 2004; Clark et al., 2011). A poor representation of the spatial heterogeneity of these ‘snowscapes’ within continental-scale land surface models (LSMs) and catchment-scale hydrological models can result in biased snow cover and runoff simulations (e.g., Déry et al., 2004; Liston, 2004; Dornes et al., 2008; Busseau et al., 2017; Mahoney et al., 2018; Castaneda-Gonzalez et al., 2019; Magnusson et al., 2019), compromising projections under climate change scenarios. As such, measuring and understanding snow cover heterogeneity, and representing it within process-based models represents one of the greatest ongoing challenges in atmospheric and hydrological sciences, which calls for innovative efforts to address this issue ( Peters-Lidard et al., 2017). This project aims to improve our understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of the snow cover in Arctic regions and its representation within process models for more robust simulations of snow cover conditions and surface energy and carbon fluxes under current and future climates. To that purpose, new SCF parameterizations will be developed, implemented, and tested in the CLASSIC LSM. Snow CCI products will be used for this purpose, in addition to in situ stations along a Subarctic-Arctic gradient that encompasses different bioclimatic zones. In a second step, an implementation of a two-layer snow scheme and blowing snow sublimation processes will be considered to improve the snowpack evolution in the Arctic region. The influence of these new developments will be assessed against the evolution of the Snow CCI variables for different land types and for the simulated surface energy and carbon fluxes. To achieve this work, collaboration with the French institutes: Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) and Institut des Géosciences de l’Environnement (IGE) will be encouraged, in addition to contributing to the Snow CCI project by producing derived interpolated datasets to ease the comparison to climate models. CLASSIC will next be forced by an ensemble of climate projections from CMIP6, downscaled and bias-corrected to ERA5 to produce new improved land simulations over the whole Arctic region. Online (coupled) simulations within CanESM are envisaged through future collaboration with Environment and Climate Change Canada.\nReferences Busseau, B.-C., Royer, A., Roy, A., Langlois, A., \u0026amp; Domine, F.

This resource provides a freshwater supply to nearly 1.4 billion people, making it a particularly vulnerable region to climate change. HMA includes the highest mountain ranges on Earth, including the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, which surround the Tibetan Plateau (TP), an area of nearly 2.5\u0026nbsp;million\u0026nbsp;km² with an average elevation of about 4000\u0026nbsp;m.\nStudying climate change in HMA is challenging because of its complex topography which makes difficult the application of climate models in this area, and limits the possibility to collect observations. The aim of this thesis is to study the variability and trends of the climate in HMA. It is based on two main objectives: (1) studying and quantifying the climate change in HMA with general circulation models (GCMs) experiments and observation datasets, and (2) improving the simulated snow cover in mountainous regions in GCMs.\nCurrent GCMs simulate a cold bias in HMA reaching an annual average value of -1.9 °C, associated with an overestimation of snow cover of 12\u0026nbsp;% and an excess of precipitation of 1.5\u0026nbsp;mm\u0026nbsp;d$^{-1}$ (relative biases of 52\u0026nbsp;% and 143\u0026nbsp;% as compared to observations). Model biases and their ability to simulate trends do not show a clear link, suggesting that model bias is not a robust criterion to discard models in trend analysis.\nThe simulated median warming in HMA over 2081-2100 as compared to 1995-2014 reaches respectively 1.9 and 6.5\u0026nbsp;°C on the low (SSP1-2.6) and the high (SSP5-8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. This warming is associated with a relative decrease in the snow cover extent of -9.4 to -32.2\u0026nbsp;% and a relative increase in precipitation of 8.5 to 24.9\u0026nbsp;% in these two respective scenarios. The warming is 11\u0026nbsp;% higher over HMA than over the other Northern Hemisphere continental surfaces, excluding the Arctic area.\n5 parameterizations of the snow cover fraction (SCF) are tested, calibrated, and validated using a snow reanalysis in HMA. The relationship between SCF and snow depth (SD) differs strongly between flat and mountainous areas, leading to an overestimation of SCF in parameterizations that do not take into account the sub-grid topography. The SCF changes with respect to SD follow a hysteresis, with a rapid increase in SCF during the accumulation phase and a slower patchy retreat during ablation periods, discarding parameterizations that do not consider this effect.\nThe use of a new SCF parameterization adapted to mountain areas in LMDZ/ORCHIDEE reduces the simulated SCF bias over mountainous regions by 5 to 10\u0026nbsp;% in winter, reducing the mean annual cold bias in HMA from -1.8\u0026nbsp;°C to around -1\u0026nbsp;°C. However, this added value is sometimes masked by other model biases. Additional datasets covering other regions should be considered to allow an optimal tuning of the SCF parameterizations.\nThe lack of snowpack observations in mountainous regions is currently a major limitation to set up realistic SCF parameterizations. Improving SCF parameterizations is one of the important developments that need to be considered when developing the sub-grid parameterizations, which are required to improve the GCMs over mountainous areas.

Indeed, snow has generally a much higher albedo compared to other surfaces and therefore reduces the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the surface. General circulation models (GCMs) usually compute the snow-cover fraction (SCF) as a diagnostic variable derived from other snow quantities, as for instance, the snow water equivalent (SWE) or the snow depth (SD). The relationship between SWE and SCF varies from simple linear relationships to more advanced parameterizations taking into account further parameters, such as snow density, ground roughness lengths, etc. However, only a few GCMs take into account the topography, while Swenson and Lawrence (2012) highlighted strong differences in snow-cover extent between plains and mountainous areas, which may be explained by the persistence of snow on the summits whereas a faster melting occurs in the valleys. In this study, we designed three new snow parameterizations that include the impact of the sub-grid topography on the SCF in the ORCHIDEE land surface model (LSM) coupled to the LMDZ atmospheric model (part of the French GCM of IPSL). This model shows a strong cold bias and an excess of SCF over the High Mountains of Asia (HMA). The new SCF parameterizations are based on the following existing ones: Swenson and Lawrence (2012; hereafter SL12), Roesch et al. (2001; hereafter R01), and a modified version of Niu and Yang (2007; hereafter NY07). These new parameterizations were calibrated over HMA using a high-resolution snow reanalysis, and compared to a deep learning model trained on the reanalysis dataset. The calibrated parameterizations SL12, R01, and the modified version of NY07 were then tested in coupled ORCHIDEE/LMDZ simulations. Preliminary results show improvements in simulated snow cover in HMA but slight deterioration in other areas depending on the model resolution. They suggest also that calibration should be extended to other snow-covered areas and should include other parameters such as the type of vegetation in particular.

Climate studies over HMA are related to serious challenges concerning the exposure of human infrastructures to natural hazards and the water resources for agriculture, drinking water and hydroelectricity to whom several hundred million inhabitants are depending. However, temperature, precipitation, and snow cover in this region are poorly described in global climate models because their coarse resolution is not adapted to the complex topography of this area. Since the first CMIP exercises, a cold model bias has been identified in HMA, however, its attribution is not obvious and may be different from one model to another. Our study focuses on a multi-model comparison of 27 CMIP6 models over 1979-2014. A cold bias is still present in near-surface air temperature over HMA reaching an annual value of -2.0 °C (± 3.2 °C), associated with an over-extended relative snow cover extent of 53 % (± 62 %), and a relative excess of precipitation of 139 % (± 38 %). Precipitation biases are uncertain because of the undercatch of solid precipitation in observations. Higher-resolution models do not systematically perform better than the coarse-gridded ones, suggesting that the development of more realistic physical parameterizations over complex topography areas is still needed. We implemented new snow cover parameterizations taking into account the sub-grid topography in the IPSL general circulation model. This model shows a strong cold bias and an excess of snow cover over HMA. These new parameterizations were calibrated over HMA using a high-resolution snow reanalysis and compared to a deep learning algorithm. Preliminary results show improvements in simulated snow cover and reduced cold bias over HMA. The residual biases suggest that other factors must be involved (e.g., tropospheric cold bias, precipitation biases, aerosol forcing uncertainties, orographic drag), and raise the potential limitation of the implemented parameterizations over permanent snow areas. Nevertheless, taking into account the sub-grid topography in the snow cover parameterization is essential to properly represent snow cover dynamics over mountainous areas.

This resource provides a freshwater supply to nearly 1.4 billion people, making it a particularly vulnerable region to climate change. HMA includes the highest mountain ranges on Earth, including the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, which surround the Tibetan Plateau (TP), an area of nearly 2.5 million km² with an average elevation of about 4000 m.\nStudying climate change in HMA is challenging because of its complex topography which makes difficult the application of climate models in this area, and limits the possibility to collect observations. The aim of this thesis is to study the variability and trends of the climate in HMA. It is based on two main objectives: (1) studying and quantifying the climate change in HMA with general circulation models (GCMs) experiments and observation datasets, and (2) improving the simulated snow cover in mountainous regions in GCMs.\nCurrent GCMs simulate a cold bias in HMA reaching an annual average value of -1.9 °C, associated with an overestimation of snow cover of 12 % and an excess of precipitation of 1.5 mm d$^{-1}$ (relative biases of 52 % and 143 % as compared to observations). Model biases and their ability to simulate trends do not show a clear link, suggesting that model bias is not a robust criterion to discard models in trend analysis.\nThe simulated median warming in HMA over 2081-2100 as compared to 1995-2014 reaches respectively 1.9 and 6.5 °C on the low (SSP1-2.6) and the high (SSP5-8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. This warming is associated with a relative decrease in the snow cover extent of -9.4 to -32.2 % and a relative increase in precipitation of 8.5 to 24.9 % in these two respective scenarios. The warming is 11 % higher over HMA than over the other Northern Hemisphere continental surfaces, excluding the Arctic area.\n5 parameterizations of the snow cover fraction (SCF) are tested, calibrated, and validated using a snow reanalysis in HMA. The relationship between SCF and snow depth (SD) differs strongly between flat and mountainous areas, leading to an overestimation of SCF in parameterizations that do not take into account the sub-grid topography. The SCF changes with respect to SD follow a hysteresis, with a rapid increase in SCF during the accumulation phase and a slower patchy retreat during ablation periods, discarding parameterizations that do not consider this effect.\nThe use of a new SCF parameterization adapted to mountain areas in LMDZ/ORCHIDEE reduces the simulated SCF bias over mountainous regions by 5 to 10 % in winter, reducing the mean annual cold bias in HMA from -1.8 °C to around -1 °C. However, this added value is sometimes masked by other model biases. Additional datasets covering other regions should be considered to allow an optimal tuning of the SCF parameterizations.\nThe lack of snowpack observations in mountainous regions is currently a major limitation to set up realistic SCF parameterizations. Improving SCF parameterizations is one of the important developments that need to be considered when developing the sub-grid parameterizations, which are required to improve the GCMs over mountainous areas.\nKeywords: High Mountain Asia, Mountain Areas, General Circulation Models, CMIP6, Snow Cover, Parameterizations\nMore details and PhD manuscript at: https://www.theses.fr/s226411\n","date":1630671300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696970098,"objectID":"c9a66b2d3f935438f991c02f81127b35","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/project/phd/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T14:15:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/phd/","section":"project","summary":"Modeling climate trends and variability in High Mountain Asia to understand cryosphere changes","tags":["Mountain Areas","GCM","CMIP6","Snow","Parameterization"],"title":"PhD (2019-2022)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande"],"categories":["Science et Climat"],"content":"Science et Climat is a French YouTube channel (English subtitles available) that intends to popularize climate related topics to better apprehend the issues raised by global warming.\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/c/ScienceetClimat\n","date":1630669320,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696970098,"objectID":"db062aca59e3c724cd04749f8e13d1d1","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/project/science-et-climat/","publishdate":"2021-09-03T13:42:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/science-et-climat/","section":"project","summary":"Chaine YouTube de vulgarisation autour de la science et du climat !","tags":["YouTube"],"title":"Science et Climat","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande"],"categories":["Media"],"content":"Compiles all media content.\n","date":1630584900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630585430,"objectID":"c2ffafec19d2afea83a45b37b248b0bb","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/project/medias/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T14:15:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/medias/","section":"project","summary":"Compiles all media content.","tags":[],"title":"Medias","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande"],"categories":["Science et Climat"],"content":"Alors je pense que vous avez tous déjà entendu parler que le niveau des mers est en train de monter, c\u0026rsquo;est ce qu\u0026rsquo;on entend assez régulièrement dans les médias avec des hausses allant de quelques dizaines de centimètres plusieurs mètres, dont on sait d\u0026rsquo;ailleurs plus vraiment à quoi s\u0026rsquo;en tenir, et qui menace nos côtes, certaines grandes villes et impacte déjà certaines îles !

If however their method does not suit your needs and you want to install your own environment, here is the method I use (it works from a Linux workstation, you have to adapt if you are under another OS). This method is not official, nor generic, if you have other tips/methods don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to share them in the comments below.\n1. Connect to your server ssh -XY -o ServerAliveInterval=60 login@server Think to add the options -XY otherwise you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to open Jupyter Notebooks in your browser. ServerAliveInterval=60 is optional, but it allows you not to get disconnected if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any activity for a while (it depends on servers).\nYou can directly make an alias in your bashrc, so you only have to type the alias in your terminal. For example:\ngvim ~/.bashrc # And add this line at the end or in an alias section if you already have one alias server='ssh -XY -o ServerAliveInterval=60 login@server' 2. Install Miniconda In general, there is not infinite space on the servers and therefore I advise you to install the minimalist version of Anaconda : Miniconda, in order to install only what you need.\nSo first of all, I download Miniconda on the server and install it:\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh During the installation, be careful to change the installation path to avoid installing it in your home, otherwise, it may saturate your space very quickly! In general, it is recommended to install it in a data space or another where you have more storage space.\n[/home/login/miniconda3] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; /data/login/miniconda3\nAt the end of the installation, I recommend that you initialize conda so that it automatically adds the correct path to your bashrc so that you can directly have the conda command available (if you prefer to put these lines somewhere else, you can adapt them).\nDo you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3 by running conda init? [yes|no] [no] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; yes Then update your bashrc:\nsource ~/.bashrc You should have a (base) that should appear in front of your command line.\nIf you are not happy, fucked up any step or you are scared\u0026hellip; that happens\u0026hellip; Just remove the folder miniconda3 (rm -r /data/login/miniconda3 or the path you put at the installation step) and then remove the lines that were added in your bashrc. Then you can start over or forget about Miniconda forever :p 3. Add conda-forge and update your installation (optional but I recommend) This step is completely optional, but it allows to facilitate the installation of future packages that would not be the basic channel of conda.\nconda config --add channels conda-forge conda config --set channel_priority strict conda update -n base -c defaults conda If you want to know more, click on the link in the title.\n4. Create an environment I do not recommend that you use your base environment. By experience, it happened to me several times to break this environment without being able to go back and to have to finally reinstall everything. The problem is that when you are not familiar with the environment you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make a backup and it is sometimes difficult to get back to something functional!\nSo here is how I work on my side, I create an environment with the name of my project and a version (for example project_v0):\nconda create -n project_v0 conda activate project_v0 Then install all the packages you need, especially jupyter (+ jupyterlab if you prefer from basic notebooks, which is my case).\nI also recommend you to install the nb_conda_kernels package in each of your environments, which will allow you to switch from one environment to another, directly from your notebooks.\nconda install nb_conda_kernels Here is an example of an environment I created for my Ph.D.: https://github.com/mickaellalande/PhD/tree/master/envs/phd To save and manage your environment, see at the end of this tutorial.\nFor simplicity, I also recommend that you add the line conda activate project_v0 to your bashrc so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to activate it every time. This should replace the (base) with the name of your environment.\n5. Configure Jupyter The problem with launching Jupyter on a server is that you will have to make an ssh bridge between your machine and the server to open Jupyter directly on your internet browser. So you have to specify to Jupyter not to open a window on the server and to open Jupyter on a specific port (if needed).\nThere are two ways to do this, either you specify all this in your command when you run Jupyter, or you create a configuration file:\nCommand line Here is an example of a command line (where XXXX would be your port number), but don\u0026rsquo;t run it yet, it would be for later!\njupyter lab --port XXXX --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser Configuration file Alternatively, you can put this directly into a configuration file and just run the command jupyter lab (or jupyter notebook):\n# Create a configuration file and edit it jupyter notebook --generate-config gvim ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py # Uncomment these lines and modify them as follow c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*' c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0' c.NotebookApp.port = XXXX c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False More informations:\nhttps://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42848130/why-i-cant-access-remote-jupyter-notebook-server Report errors (optionnal) Optionally you can also send automatically report to Anaconda in case of errors:\nconda config --set report_errors true 6. Launch a job This step depends on the server you are on, so find out how to launch an interactive job. Depending on the servers and their security level, it can be more or less complicated (even more so during teleworking if you use intermediate machines!).\nThink of adapting the memory you need, because very often jobs are killed if you exceed it.\n7. Run Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab Once your job is launched you can now directly run jupyter lab or jupyter notebook if you configured Jupyter (see above) otherwise:\njupyter lab --port XXXX --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser Then you need to make a tunnel from your own terminal (on your PC, not the server), which is usually a command as:\nssh -L XXXX:hostname:XXXX login@server with possible other flags as -fNL (but I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar with that, so go and look what you need, ex: https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=ssh+-L+-N+-f+-l)\nThen you can open the link directly given from Jupyter on the server, which will open on your browser.\nHere is an example of a script, to get automatically the ssh tunnel from one of the servers I use and run jupyter lab (you can inspire yourself from that and adapt it to your needs): jupyterlab.sh.\n8. Save your environment Once you have something functional and stable enough. I advise you to save your environment and not to touch it anymore (not even to update it). If you want to update it or install new packages (which would cause version changes in your other packages), in that case I advise you to clone your current environment and do some tests then if you get something stable again, call it with the same project name and increment the version number by making a new backup. This way you can always go back to an old environment and/or rebuild it identically (at least on the machine you were on).\nTo save your environment here are the different methods I use:\nconda list --explicit \u0026gt; projet_v0.txt conda env export \u0026gt; projet_v0.yml conda env export --from-history \u0026gt; projet_v0_fh.yml The first one allows you to have the exact version of packages on the machine you are using and their dependencies, which will allow you to have exactly the same environment (however it might not work on some other machines). The second one is similar to the first one but with the yaml format. The last one allows you to only have the names of the packages you installed with their version number if specified (what I advise you to add otherwise it might not work in the future). This last one allows sharing your environment across different platforms/OS, but without a guaranty that it will work (knowing that some packages are not always available across all platforms) and even on your own machine/server if you didn\u0026rsquo;t specify all version numbers, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that you won\u0026rsquo;t succeed to make it work in the future. Hence I recommend saving your environment under different format/version.\nTo get more information, go and check the conda documentation: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html\nI also recommend you to document your environment with a README, so you know how you set it up, what\u0026rsquo;s inside, etc., here is an example from my environment: https://github.com/mickaellalande/PhD/tree/master/envs/phd.\nI hope this will help you! I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert with conda myself, but this is a sharing of the experience I\u0026rsquo;ve gained over the past few years. Feel free to ask questions in the comments and/or fill in any points that I haven\u0026rsquo;t explained well or that are missing!\n","date":1619078436,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672910257,"objectID":"b728a70d28ce6c5291a7bcf9fd8260f8","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/post/tutorial/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-a-server/","publishdate":"2021-04-22T10:00:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/tutorial/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-a-server/","section":"post","summary":"First of all, I recommend you to look at what your server proposes as a method to launch Jupyter Notebooks.

Nevertheless, it can be used as a basis, but please refer to the Wowchemy documentation first. I updated all the links below to refer to their new websites. I guess you are wondering how to make an academic website on your GitHub with the address .github.io. There are, of course, the solutions proposed directly by GitHub page, however, it looks a bit \u0026ldquo;old school\u0026rdquo; in my opinion. Another option is to make the site by yourself in markdown, but it seemed quite long and tedious. I finally came across Wowchemy Hugo Blox1 for Hugo^2 which suits my needs and is the purpose of this tutorial! Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions and/or additional information.\nYou need to be a bit familiar with the basics of GitHub, but you don\u0026rsquo;t need any knowledge of html/css. 1. Make a GitHub page You can directly follow the instructions on their page: https://pages.github.com/.\nThe important is to create the repository your-name.github.io, and then we will update the content of this repository automatically with a Wowchemy Hugo Blox Academic template.\n2. Install Academic Theme and Hugo Again you\u0026rsquo;ll find the steps on their website: https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/deployment/#github-pages\nThere are different ways to install the Academic theme. The recommended installation will automatically deploy it on a free server, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a way to link it to the GitHub page later, so I recommend following the Git installation from the link above. Install Hugo I had some trouble with installing Hugo with Homebrew on Linux. If you do have the same problem, I advise you to try to install it with the snap version (don\u0026rsquo;t install it with apt-get because the version is not updated: see this issue). All this Academic theme is based on the Hugo Framework so it is necessary to install it.\nFork the Academic Kickstart repository The new repository name is: wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv, so replace academic-kickstart by starter-hugo-academic theme-academic-cv in the following paragraph. It will automatically create a new repository academic-kickstart in your GitHub account. This repository will allow you to manage your website, and then publish it into the previously created repository `your-name.github.io``. Finally, you just need to clone and initialize the theme on your computer:\ngit clone https://github.com/your-name/academic-kickstart.git cd academic-kickstart git submodule update --init --recursive 3. Deploy your website on your GitHub page We need now to add your-name.github.io repository as a submodule inside the public folder of the academic-kickstart repository as explained in this documentation.\nThe method below seems outdated, so follow the link above. git submodule add -f -b master https://github.com/your-name/your-name.github.io.git public Then you need to generate the website with the hugo command. First, you can commit and push your changes from the academic-kickstart repository on GitHub and then do the same for the your-name.github.io submodule and your website will be available online!\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot; git push -u origin master hugo # Generate the website inside the public directory cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Build website\u0026quot; git push origin master cd .. You can easily make this automatic with a bash script for the future, for example: update.sh, and then you only have to write: sh update.sh your_commit_message.\n4. Update your content and customize your page You can then follow the documentation Getting Started With the Page Builder and Customization, where you\u0026rsquo;ll find all the information! Before to start updating, launch the hugo server from your local academic-kickstart folder with the command:\nhugo server you will be able to have an instant preview in your browser before uploading it to GitHub. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know any editing software, I can advise you Atom in combination with typora which is convenient for directly editing the content with markdown.\nSource Themes Academic 4.8.0\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":1589881138,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701710348,"objectID":"4e7207fc5fc53a1d7243a0e4b933c502","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/post/tutorial/how-to-create-an-academic-github-page-with-hugo/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T11:38:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/tutorial/how-to-create-an-academic-github-page-with-hugo/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["Website","GitHub"],"title":"How to Create an Academic/Wowchemy/Hugo Blox GitHub Page With Hugo?","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1589527800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672910257,"objectID":"61ac81bc8cf49365e8e17e4e33a73808","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/phd/lmdz/lmdz-pour-letude-du-climat-regional/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T18:28:51+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd/lmdz/lmdz-pour-letude-du-climat-regional/","section":"talk","summary":"LMDZ for regional climate study : “cold bias” in High Mountain Asia (HMA)","tags":["LMDZ","High Mountain Asia"],"title":"LMDZ for Regional Climate Studies","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1578900600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672910257,"objectID":"57c06a72efdc34f7072d1f14392d225d","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/phd/lmdz/pedalons/20200113_zoom/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T17:48:38+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd/lmdz/pedalons/20200113_zoom/","section":"talk","summary":"Modélisation de la variabilité et des tendances climatiques en Himalaya pour une meilleure compréhension de leurs impacts sur la cryosphère","tags":["LMDZ","High Mountain Asia"],"title":"PEDALONS: Zoom and Regional Climates","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Redouane Lguensat","Mickaël Lalande","Sally Close","Thierry Penduff"],"categories":null,"content":"The variability of sea-level anomalies (SLA) observed by satellite altimeters combines two components: a forced component paced by the atmospheric variability, and an intrinsic and chaotic component emerging from the ocean itself.This work presents a deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) trained to estimate the forced variability from SLA observations.
