However, the regional imprint of climate change is still poorly understood, in particular, because it is mixed with large internal variability. Such uncertainty is even more pronounced in mountainous areas because: (i) meteorological in situ observations are scarce and (ii) the coarse resolution of global climate models is not adapted to reproduce the surface-atmosphere interactions and local circulation patterns over areas of complex topography. For these reasons, climate change is poorly known, and future scenarios are particularly uncertain in the Himalayan region, whereas they can be associated with major socio-environmental impacts, in particular in terms of water resources and natural hazards. This Ph.D.1 project aims to investigate trends and variability of the Himalayan climate with the LMDZ global model with a stretched grid centered over this area. First, a 1900-2010 experiment will be run with a configuration nudged toward the ERA-20C atmospheric reanalysis. Long-term simulations will be used to investigate climate trends over the last century and decadal to multi-decadal changes of atmospheric conditions that could explain temporary positive trends of glacier mass balance in this area. Second, a subgrid-scale parameterization of the surface energy balance will be implemented in the model, with the aim to improve the representation of the climate and the snow cover in mountainous areas. Third, LMDZ will be used in configurations nudged toward future scenarios and experiments dedicated to the differentiation of aerosol and GHG forcings. This Ph.D. project will allow a better understanding of the climate and the cryosphere changes in the Himalaya, with the final goal to provide different climate scenarios for the next century in this mountainous area.\n  supervised by Martin Ménégoz and Gerhard Krinner \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1589900900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590421328,"objectID":"c9a66b2d3f935438f991c02f81127b35","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/project/phd/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T17:08:20+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/phd/","section":"project","summary":"Modeling climate trends and variability in the Himalaya to understand cryosphere changes","tags":["Himalaya","Cryosphere","LMDZ"],"title":"PhD (2019-2022)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande"],"categories":["Tutorial"],"content":"I guess you are wondering how to make an academic website on your GitHub with the address .github.io. There are, of course, the solutions proposed directly by GitHub page, however, it looks a bit \u0026ldquo;old school\u0026rdquo; in my opinion. Another option is to make the site by yourself in markdown, but it seemed quite long and tedious. Personally, I finally came across the Academic theme1 for Hugo2 that suits my needs and is the purpose of this tutorial! Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions and/or additional information.\n You need to be a bit familiar with the basics of GitHub, but you don\u0026rsquo;t need any knowledge of html/css.   1. Make a GitHub page You can directly follow the instructions on their page: https://pages.github.com/.\n The important is to create the repository your-name.github.io, then we will update the content of this repository automatically with the Academic Theme.\n2. Install Academic Theme and Hugo Again you\u0026rsquo;ll find the steps on their website: https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/#install-with-git\n There are different ways to install the Academic theme. The recommended installation will automatically deploy it on a free server, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a way to link it to the GitHub page later, so I recommend to follow the Git installation from the link above.   Install Hugo I had some trouble with installing Hugo with Homebrew on Linux. If you do have the same problem, I advise you to try to install it with the snap version (don\u0026rsquo;t install it with apt-get because the version is not updated: see this issue). All this Academic theme is based on the Hugo Framework so it is necessary to install it.\nFork the Academic Kickstart repository   It will automatically create a new repository academic-kickstart in your GitHub account. This repository will allow you to manage your website, and then to publish it into the previously create repository your-name.github.io. Finally, you just need to clone and initialize the theme on your computer:\ngit clone https://github.com/your-name/academic-kickstart.git cd academic-kickstart git submodule update --init --recursive  3. Deploy your website on your GitHub page We need now to add your-name.github.io repository as a submodule inside the public folder of the academic-kickstart repository as explained in this documentation.\ngit submodule add -f -b master https://github.com/your-name/your-name.github.io.git public  Then you need to generate the website with the hugo command. First, you can commit and push your changes from the academic-kickstart repository on GitHub and then do the same for the your-name.github.io submodule and your website will be available online!\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot; git push -u origin master hugo # Generate the website inside the public directory cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Build website\u0026quot; git push origin master cd ..  You can easily make this automatic with a bash script for the future, for example: update.sh, and then you only have to write: sh update.sh your_commit_message.\n4. Update your content and customize your page You can then follow the documentation  Getting Started With the Page Builder and  Customization, where you\u0026rsquo;ll find all the information! Basically before to start updating, launch the hugo server from your local academic-kickstart folder with the command:\nhugo server  you will be able to have an instant preview in your browser before uploading it to GitHub. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know any editing software, I can advise you Atom in combination with typora that is really convenient for directly editing the content with markdown.\n  Source Themes Academic 4.8.0 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hugo Static Site Generator v0.70.0/extended linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-05-13T17:30:34Z \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1589881138,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617287846,"objectID":"4e7207fc5fc53a1d7243a0e4b933c502","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/post/tutorial/how-to-create-an-academic-github-page-with-hugo/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T11:38:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/tutorial/how-to-create-an-academic-github-page-with-hugo/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["Website","Github"],"title":"How to Create an Academic GitHub Page With Hugo?","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1589527800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617975773,"objectID":"d45c1dbef5dcab06504ad74bae54c46f","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/phd/lmdz/lmdz-pour-letude-du-climat-regional/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T18:28:51+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd/lmdz/lmdz-pour-letude-du-climat-regional/","section":"talk","summary":"LMDZ for regional climate study : “cold bias” in High Mountain Asia (HMA)","tags":["LMDZ","Himalaya"],"title":"LMDZ for Regional Climate Studies","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mickaël Lalande"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1578900600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617975773,"objectID":"1b13ff4922a49268e0aa5e850f50c4e6","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/phd/lmdz/pedalons/20200113_zoom/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T17:48:38+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd/lmdz/pedalons/20200113_zoom/","section":"talk","summary":"Modélisation de la variabilité et des tendances climatiques en Himalaya pour une meilleure compréhension de leurs impacts sur la cryosphère","tags":["PEDALONS","LMDZ","Himalaya"],"title":"PEDALONS: Zoom and Regional Climates","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Quick presentation of my PhD\n","date":1574233200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617975773,"objectID":"d1b1815a5cca94bb6f63aed3c1746dcb","permalink":"https://mickaellalande.github.io/talk/phd/journee-des-theses/2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T18:25:37+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd/journee-des-theses/2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Quick presentation of my PhD","tags":["Journée des thèses","Himalaya"],"title":"Journée des Thèses 2019","type":"talk"}]
